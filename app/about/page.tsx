    answer: "My journey started in 2014 as DJ, being 15 then. A year after, I finished my GCSEs and went to SFX Sixth Form College for a BTEC in IT â€“ where I learned Photoshop and picked up Python. Since then, I've produced results no matter the discipline â€“ from DJing to graphic design, plus many others. Now, I'm a dev focused on disruptive tech."

          <p>I&apos;m the founder of Metasyde LTD., where we build scalable solutions leveraging disruptive technologies like AI and Web3.</p>

          <p>
            In 2015, I finished my GCSEs and went to <Link target="_blank" className="font-bold text-primary underline" href="https://www.sfx.ac.uk/">St. Francis Xavier College</Link>, where I began my tech journey by experimenting with graphic design and coding with Python, setting the foundation for my future in fullstack and AI development.

          <p>
            During my years at the <Link target="_blank" className="font-bold text-primary underline" href="https://www.northampton.ac.uk/">University of Northampton</Link> (2017-2020), I didn&apos;t just stick to one thing. I explored everything from journalism to UI/UX design, motion graphics, video editing, and even bartending. But it was in my third year that I discovered my true passion: Artificial Intelligence. This revelation led to an A* grade and the publication of a featured Medium article with The Startup, where I shared my process and insights on AI.
          </p>
          <p>I graduated in 2020â€“during a time where the world was brought to a stop by the global pandemic. Picture being a 21-year-old fresh out of university with a computing degree, burning passion for emerging technologies and an ambitious spirit, but finding yourself stuck with a flimsy job market and a whooping <strong>5-figures in student debt</strong>. <i>That</i> was my intro into the real world.</p>
          <p>Instead of letting that define me, I flipped the script. I hopped on mastering hot, in-demand skills, which led me to secure a Â£5000/mo Fullstack Web3 Developer contract role at the age of 23. That opportunity was the catalyst for what will become <Link className="font-bold text-primary underline" href="https://metasyde.com?ref=enrictrillo">Metasyde</Link>, my company dedicated to building profitable and innovative solutions with disruptive technologies.</p>
